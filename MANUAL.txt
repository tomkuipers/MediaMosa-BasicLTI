MediaMosa BasicLTI tool provider

Overview

The MediaMosa BasicLTI tool provider supports playing, uploading, searching and editing of media content. The MediaMosa tool is a teaching and learning tool which an instructor uses to manage media content in a Learning Management System (LMS). The tool acts as a  BasicLTI tool provider.  BasicLTI enables one integration method for all mainstream LMS's. For an indepth overview of BasicLTI watch this video http://vimeo.com/14100773.

Details

Basic Learning Tools Interoperability (BasicLTI) is a standard developed by IMS Global Learning Consortium. BasicLTI is designed as a solution for the problem where the same tool functionality had to be coded for multiple LMS platforms. Doing this requires vendor specific knowledge on how to build such a  tool (or ‘module’, or ‘buildingblock’) and incorporate it in a specific LMS. The proprietary interfaces are very similar but different. And involve high costs of integrating. BasicLTI provides a simple common plugin system. An LMS can be a tool consumer and offer functionality of an external tool to its users. There are a growing number of tool providers and tool consumers. For an overview see http://www.imsglobal.org/cc/statuschart.cfm.

A tool consumer and the tool MediaMosa tool provider share a key-value pair which is used for authorization through the  OAuth protocol. OAuth makes sure the tool is secured, the information channels not open to the world, but can only be accessed from a preconfigured LMS. You can even configure multiple LMS within the same tool. The tool has support for internationalization (i18n). Currently English and Dutch languages are available. 

Requirements

- MediaMosa  platform access
- Tomcat 7 servlet container
- Learning Management System with a BasicLTI consumer support (e.g.: Blackboard, Sakai or Moodle)
- Optional: A separate database. An in memory persistent HSQL database is provided.

Installation

Build the application by checking out the repo at https://github.com/tomkuipers/MediaMosa-BasicLTI and running ‘mvn package’. The result is a file called ‘mmbltiprovider.war’. Copy this war file in the webapps directory of your Tomcat installation.

Create a file called ‘basiclti_consumersecrets.properties’ (or copy from $CATALINA_HOME /webapps/ mmbltiprovider/WEB-INF/ basiclti_consumersecrets.properties ) to $CATALINA_HOME/conf. Modify accordingly. Note, the default values are known to the world and should be changed.

Setup your connection to the MediaMosa platform by editing the file   $CATALINA_HOME /webapps/mmbltprovider/WEB-INF/classes/mediamosa.properties. Supply a valid hostname, username and password combination.

Restart Tomcat. The application is running at http://your_host:8080/mmbltiprovider/mmblti


Configuration

Configuration of BasicLTI consumers varies from vendor to vendor. When asked for a launch url point it to http://your_host:8080/mmbltiprovider/mmblti/tool.

See README.txt for instructions on how to configure Blackboard and Sakai.


Functionality

The MediaMosa BasicLTI provider tool allows users enrolled as ‘Instructor’ to upload, play, search, edit metadata and organize media resources. 
Users enrolled as ‘Student’ have limited functionality and can only play media content selected by an Instructor.

Usage

When the tool is launched by an Instructor a navigation bar is shown in the opening screen. This window shows the resources for a particular course and resource link combination. Available options are Tool, Browse, Upload, Search, Logout.

Tool – shows selected resources
Browse – browse your media content
Upload – upload media content
Search – search for media also from other users
Logout – end the current session
